# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!  
To keep the workflow consistent and easy to review, please follow these steps:

---

## 1. Create an Issue First
- Before writing any code, **open an issue** in this repository.
- The issue should clearly state:
  - **Problem** you found, OR  
  - **Feature** you want to add.
- This ensures everyone is aligned before work begins.

---

## 2. Create a Branch
- Once the issue is approved, create a new branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b yourname-feature
  ```

- Use a short, descriptive name for the branch.

---

## 3. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
- When your work is ready, open a PR against the `main` branch.
- **Link the issue** you created in the PR description (use `Closes #<issue_number>`).
- PR details must be:
- **Precise**: Describe exactly what changed.
- **Sufficient**: Enough context so the reviewer can merge confidently without guessing.

---

## 4. Code Review
- Address reviewer comments promptly.
- Keep changes focused on the issue/feature (avoid unrelated edits).

---

## 5. Merge
- Once approved, the PR will be merged.
- Your contribution is complete—thank you!
